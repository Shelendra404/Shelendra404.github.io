# Shelendra404.github.io

This is a test project, in which I was given project files in a language I had never worked with before, nor had I any knowledge of the syntax. Task was completed succesfully in the given amount of time (2 hours).

## Information

This project implements a simple UI to search books in library.
It utilizes [HELMET-KIRJASTOJEN AINEISTOLUETTELOT API](https://api.finna.fi/swagger-ui/?url=%2Fapi%2Fv1%3Fswagger#!)
to find books.

You can choose to implement either Task 1 or 2. You are free to modify/refactor
anything in the codebase.

## Task

The current implementation only allows searching books by its title. Many users
have often requested that they would also like to search books by eg.
author's name. Implement a way to search for books by author's name (or some
other field/fields of your choice) and display the chosen field in the result
list as well.
